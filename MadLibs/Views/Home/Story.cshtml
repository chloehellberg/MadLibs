<h1>Halloween Mad Libs</h1>
<p>Halloween is the best time to @Model.VerbOne. The weather is @Model.AdjectiveOne and you go door to door, saying "Trick or Treat!" and people give you @Model.PluralNoun to eat. This year, I will dress up as a @Model.Color @Model.Noun. If someone says "Trick!" instead of giving you a treat, you might have to @Model.VerbTwo to try and scare them into giving you a @Model.AdjectiveTwo @Model.Food as a treat.</p>
